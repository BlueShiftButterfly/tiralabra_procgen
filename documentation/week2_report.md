# Week 2 Report

22.1.2024 - 27.1.2024

## Progress report

Early in the week I did not progress much in terms of code, but I planned more of the program architecture. 
On Friday I mainly worked on the visual engine part of the project to get it to a state that I can start debugging and visualising the different algorithms to be used. 
Saturday was spent on trying to create an implementation of Bowyer-Watson, but couldn't finish it. I added the pylint configuration for code quality tracking. I didn't have time to add unit testing to the project unfortunately.

This week I learned that I should be more careful about what areas to focus on during development. I underestimated the time needed to create the algorithms and unit tests and didn't have time to finish them. I also am not sure if the entire program needs comprehensive testing or only the algorithm/backend parts.

Next week I will try to finish Bowyer-Watson at least to a working state, start working on the other algorithms and adding unit testing.
