# Week 1 Report

## Progress report

During this first week I have familiarised myself with the subject and researched different algorithms and
methods to use. I have not progressed on the code of the program itself but I have planned the design and execution.
I have learned about procedural generation and different graph generation/traversal algorithms. Next I will
create a basic prototype version for creating a graph with random points and connections with the algorithms mentioned
in the specification document. I will also work on the program back end needed for the visualising of the 2D environment.

## Used hours

I used about 4 hours on this project during this first week.
