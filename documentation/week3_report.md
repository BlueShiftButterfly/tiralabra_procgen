# Week 3 Report

29.1.2024 - 3.2.2024

## Progress report

This week I mainly worked on implementing the Bowyer-Watson algorithm, with some tweaks to the graphical components. 
I added some logic for easier visualization of the triangulation result. 
Later in the week I finished an unoptimized version of Bowyer-Watson. The program now generates random points inside a square
and then triangulates them and showing the result to the user.

When working on the algorithm, I found out that Bowyer-Watson requires all circumcircles to be inside of the supertriangle,
and as such to theoretically cover all possible configurations, the supertriangle would need to be infinitely large.
I still have to figure out how to implement this or if it can be safely ignored.

Next I will work on other algorithms and data-structures, such as Prim's algorithm and A*. I might also work on
improving and optimizing the triangulation algorithm.
