## Week 4 Report

5.2.2024 - 10.2.2024

# Progress report
This week I mainly worked on creating more unit tests and starting on implementing Prim's algorithm. Creating unit tests
was very helpful since it helped me understand some issues I had with Bowyer-Watson. Implementing Prim's algorithm has been challenging and
I did not progress as much as I had hoped to. I also started working on the implementation document and user guide. I need to focus more
on the program's architecture, since whilst the algorithms are nicely compartmentalized, 
the engine module is a bit of a mess in it's current state. In the future I want to add some user inputs to the program, since at this stage there
are no other ways to influence map generation than modifying the code directly.
