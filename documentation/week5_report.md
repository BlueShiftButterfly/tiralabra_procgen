## Week 5 Report

11.2.2024 - 17.2.2024

# Progress report
This week I finished working on Prim's algorithm. I also created a separate point generation and extra hallway connector class. I also worked on being
able to display the final map using a grid of sprites. Next week I will have to finish A* and the grid, so that a map can be created from start to finish.
